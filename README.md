# BenQyou v.1.0.0

A simple quiz app for practising foreign languages.

## About

I created this app for my own purposes so it is not super complexed but feel free to use it or fork it! The idea was simple: you have to upload key-value pairs and you'll get a quiz.

### The name

The app was designed for myself to learn Japanese words. "Benkyou" means "to learn" in Japanese so I added Q which stands for Quiz :)

## How to use

The app is hosted here:

tba

And you can simply use the app directly from the link. Please prepare .txt or .pdf file with key-value pairs. Each key-value pair should be on a separate line, with the two words in a pair separated by the "=" character.

See the example below:
家 = house
電気 = electricity
大学 = university
...

Please enter more than 4 examples. You can edit some words or delete them from your list from the app before starting the quiz as shown below. Make sure that there are no empty words.

Then you can start the quiz. You will see questions in random order with randomly choosen answers (one is correct). Press `Next Question` to check the answer and go next.
